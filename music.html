            <h2>Everything Is Beautiful - 2016</h2>
            <p>After we finished writing Dreamer, we really didn't know what our future as a band was. For awhile, we thought the project would likely return to a solo effort. We stopped practicing and most of the band focused on other projects. Over time, Bruce wrote a handful of demos and eventually showed them to Nick, which sparked some excitement. With that, and Chris' idea to record in a cabin, in June of 2015, the five of us left our 'real lives' behind in Massachusetts and relocated up to Glover, Vermont for eight days with all our music equipment. No distractions or stress. Despite blowing two speakers and a fuse in Joe's bass cab the first night, it was peaceful and productive. Every day we would wake up, make coffee, jam, eat, relax, and take in the Vermont scenery. The cabin was perfect in every way. It was inspiring and sounded incredible. We left with eight of the eleven songs on Everything Is Beautiful fully written. When we came back to Massachusetts, we went back to our day jobs, but every individual member took charge on various aspects of the release. Chris organized everything we had to do with the MEGAZORD spreadsheet. The excitement was back. We took our time to finish our ideas, and the end result is something we're all incredibly proud of.</p><br/>
            <p>"Everything is beautiful" was a thought Bruce had while flying over the Grand Canyon. It fits the general dichotic concept we were going for: good vs evil, light vs dark, and the idea that that even dark times can have some positive in them.</p>

            <h2>Dreamer - 2014</h2>
            <p>Dreamer was a complicated album. We were burnt out and forcing ourselves to write for really no reason other than having the feeling that we needed a follow up to Monophonic. Two of the songs that would end up on the album, Decayer and Conceiver, were written and performed for months. We toured with them, although they were unnamed at the time. The rest of the songs slowly formed over a long and discouraging time period of about 8 months. Sleeper was written by Nick using his looper and all the guitars were tracked exclusively by him. Sonder was put together based off of demo ideas Nick had. Dreamer was a simple, peaceful track Chris put together while trying to spark some creativity in the studio. Mourner was originally a demo started by Bruce that was restructured and rewritten as a band multiple times. Day Bringer was mainly Steve playing around with a synth at the studio. Everything felt very disjointed.</p><br/>
            <p>Brian Morgante, a friend who has done design work for us in the past, had some very positive words to say about the songs. Without his words of encouragement, this album may not have seen the light of day.</p><br/>
            <p>Conceptually, the "bookends" represent falling asleep and waking up respectively. The other tracks represent different dream states. This worked well with the general "dreamy" sound of songs. The -er suffix used at the end of all the song titles was arbitrary. We took a long, much needed hiatus after we finished recording.</p>

            <h2>Monophonic - 2012</h2>
            <p>Monophonic was the beginning. After spending a few years focusing on school and less so on music, Bruce felt the itch to start a new project, a project that eventually became Pray for Sound. Inspired by his hearing issues, he took the time to write down the story behind the entire ordeal: the highs, the lows, and every major event surrounding the cholesteatoma in his left ear. With a handful of parts written and a timeline to help fill in the blank spaces, Monophonic was born. Magnus Lindberg of Cult of Luna, a huge inspiration, mixed and mastered the album. A fun project became a complete set of songs that told a story from beginning to end without language.</p>
            <p>After Monophonicâ€™s release, Pray for Sound saw some minor successes. A small fan base was amassed, and the idea of playing the songs on Monophonic to a live audience became a goal. Joe, Chris, Nick, and Steve were brought in to perform the songs. We clicked. Not long after, we started working on songs together and everyone officially became contributing members.</p>
