        <h1>Fuck it!</h1>
        <p>Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch. Uncle Gob, was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood?</p>
        <p>Also, your knee is on my heart. What, so the guy we are meeting with can't even grow his own hair? COME ON! Oh…yeah…the guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth?</p>
        <p>Turns out he ended up getting too friendly with the teddy bear. This was a big get for God. I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? But anyhoo, can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? If mother sees this, she will blow a cow. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter.</p>
