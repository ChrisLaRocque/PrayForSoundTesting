        <h2>New music</h2>
        <h3>Thursday, July 12th, 2018</h3>
        <p >We have a lot of new music on our hands.  Some of the songs are complete and mastered, some are written but not recorded, and some are just incomplete ideas.  You'll hear some of them soon.  Probably sooner than you think...</p>

        <h2>Local Run</h2>
        <h3>Sunday, September 27th, 2017</h3>
        <p>In about two weeks, we head out on a relatively local run including the first ever Dunk!USA in Burlington, VT.  Catch us now before we go into winter writing hibernation.  See the <a href="https://prayforsound.com/tour">tour page</a> for details...</p>

        <h2>Thank you!</h2>
        <h3>Tuesday, June 20th, 2017</h3>
        <p>Our European tour (with Lost in Kiev and Labirinto) and North East US tour (with InAeona) were both huge successes.  Thank you to all involved and those who came out to support Pray for Sound.</p><br/>
        <p>What's left over of our limited tour merch is now available on our <a href="https://prayforsound.bandcamp.com/merch" target="_blank">store</a>.  We also have left over European tour posters, which we'll be giving away at future shows for free.</p><br/>
        <p>We'll be working on several surprises throughout the summer and playing the first ever Dunk!USA (with Pelican, Coastlands, Set and Setting, and more TBA) in Burlington, Vermont in the fall.  See you out there.</p><br/>
        <p>Love,<br/>Pray for Sound</p>

        <h2>Shows!</h2>
        <h3>Wednesday, March 1st, 2017</h3>
        <p>If you didn't already hear through our social media accounts, we'll be joining a ton of incredible bands at Dunk!Festival in Zottegem, Belgium in May. While across the pond, we'll be playing a handful of shows in the surrounding areas with some exciting bands too. We're also currently planning a few one off shows and runs in the US.</p><br/>
        <p>In the meantime, Chris and Steve have been incredibly busy recording hit records at <a href="http://www.kennedystudios.productions/" target="_blank">Kennedy Studios</a>, and we're all having fun demoing out new material.</p><br/>
        <p>See you soon.</p>

        <h2>Everything Is Beautiful Is Officially Available Now</h2>
        <h3>Friday, September 23rd, 2016</h3>
        <p>Everything Is Beautiful has been in the works for over two years and today we finally get to share it with you. Our Bandcamp page is streaming the full album, physical orders will be shipping over the next few days, and all other major media outlets such as iTunes, Amazon, and Spotify will have the album VERY soon, if not already.</p><br/>
        <p>Bundles and limited edition merch is still available on our store but only for a limited time. If you're interested in these, grab one while you can! Over the next few months we'll also be publicly releasing more content including a 20 minute making of documentary and a full live session of us playing the entire album in the cabin we wrote it.</p><br/>
        <p>We hope you enjoy the album. Your support means the world to us.</p><br/>
        <p>Love,</p>
        <p>Bruce, Chris, Joe, Nick, and Steve</p>
